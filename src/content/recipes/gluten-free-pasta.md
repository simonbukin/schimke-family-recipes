Ingredients:

- Gluten-free all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 cups
- Xanthan gum, 1 tsp
- Fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp
- Large eggs, 3
- Water, 2 tbsp
- Olive oil, 1 tbsp

Cookware:

- Large mixing bowl, 1
- Rolling pin, 1
- Parchment paper, 1
- Sharp knife or pizza cutter, 1
- Large pot, 1
- Plastic wrap, 1

Steps:

- In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and fine sea salt.
- Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and add eggs, water, and olive oil.
- Gradually incorporate the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until a shaggy dough forms.
- Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
- Shape into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
- Process the dough into whatever shape you would like (a pasta roller is recommended). Let the pasta dry if you would like it to hold its shape more strongly.
- Cook in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes until al dente.
- Drain and serve immediately.
