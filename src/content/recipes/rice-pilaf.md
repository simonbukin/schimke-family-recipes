Cookware:

- Deep skillet, 1

Ingredients:

- Olive oil, 4 tablespoons
- Large onion (white or yellow), 1 
- Large garlic cloves, 4 
- Orzo, 1 cup
- White rice, 2 cups
- Stock (vegetable or chicken), 6 cups
- Coriander, 0.5 teaspoon
- Garlic powder, 0.5 teaspoon
- Onion powder, 0.5 teaspoon
- Paprika, 0.5 teaspoon
- Salt, 5 teaspoons

Steps:

- Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium in a cast iron skillet, deep skillet, or pot. Add garlic and onion and saut√© for 60-90 seconds.
- If using stock that's been stored in the fridge, take it out of the fridge to warm to room temperature. Or you can heat it in a pot or put it in a Pyrex measuring cup and pop it in the microwave (using cold stock will add to the time it takes to bring it to a boil).
- Add orzo and stir well to coat orzo. Toast for 3 minutes, stirring often.
- Add remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then add rice. Stir to ensure that all of the rice is coated in the oil. Toast rice for 4-5 minutes until rice is translucent.
- Add spices: garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, paprika, and salt to the rice and stir to combine.
- Slowly add warm or room temperature stock to the pan. Turn up heat and bring it to a boil, then turn down heat to medium/low (a gentle simmer), cover, and let cook for 15 minutes (or follow the cooking time on your rice package). Don't remove the lid until the cooking time is up!
- After 15 minutes, remove rice from heat and let rest, covered, for 3 minutes.
- Finally, remove lid, then fluff with a fork and serve immediately.
