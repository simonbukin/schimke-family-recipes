Ingredients:

- Pasta, 8 oz
- Avocado, 1
- Basil, 3 oz
- Parsley, 1/2 bunch
- Garlic, 5 cloves
- Nutritional Yeast, 1/4 cup
- Lemon Juice, 1
- Red Chili Flakes, 1/4 tsp (Optional)
- Vegetable Broth, 1/4 cup
- Salt, 1/2 tsp

Cookware:

- Large pot, 1
- Measuring spoons, 1

Steps:

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook your Pasta according to the package instructions.
- In the meantime, combine all of the Pesto ingredients in a Food Processor / Blender and process until evenly incorporated. If youâ€™d like your Pesto to be thinner, add additional Vegetable Broth in 2 tbsp increments as necessary.
- Drain the pasta, then return to the Pot and toss over low heat with the Pesto until warmed. Serve as desired. Store any leftover sauce in the fridge for up to one week, or it can be frozen for up to one month!
